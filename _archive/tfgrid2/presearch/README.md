Get into the container with,

```docker exec -it ps bash```

Verify the node runnning by checking the digibyte process, you could see it running as below

```
root@presearch:/opt# ps -ef
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:02 /app/presearch-node
   16 root      0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -k start
   20 apache    0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -k start
   21 apache    0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -k start
